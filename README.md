# Learning Management System (LMS)

Welcome to the Eurobliz LMS System repository. This project is a comprehensive educational platform designed to streamline course management, student enrollment, and administration.

## 📂 Project Overview

The system is divided into two main components:

- **[Backend (lms-BE)](./lms-BE/README.md)**: A robust REST API built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, and **SQLAlchemy**. Handles business logic, authentication, and data persistence.
- **[Frontend (lms-FE)](./lms-FE/README.md)**: A modern web interface built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**. Provides an intuitive user experience for all stakeholders.

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

1. Set up the virtual environment.
2. Configure the database with Docker.
3. Run migrations.
4. Start the server (`http://127.0.0.1:8000`).

### 2. Frontend Setup
