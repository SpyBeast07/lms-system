# LMS Frontend — React

The frontend layer of the LMS System. A type-safe, feature-driven React application with **role-separated dashboards**, **school-scoped data fetching**, and a strict no-stale-state policy on session transitions.

## 🗺️ Routing & Dashboard Separation

Routes are split into four protected trees, each guarded by `ProtectedRoute` which checks `allowedRoles`:

### `/admin/*` — Super Admin Dashboard
Accessible only to `super_admin`. Manages:
- **Schools Management** (`/admin/schools`) — create, update, set subscription windows
- **Users** (`/admin/users`) — view/create/delete super_admins and principals
- **System Health** (`/admin/health`)
- **Activity Logs** (`/admin/activity-logs`)
- **Signup Requests** (`/admin/signup-requests`)
- **Password Requests** (`/admin/password-requests`)

> ⚠️ The **File Storage page is not available in the admin dashboard**. It is only accessible to principals.

### `/principal/*` — Principal Dashboard
Accessible only to `principal`. School-scoped to the principal's assigned school:
- **Users** — manages teachers within the school
- **Courses** — create, view, soft-delete, restore
- **Teacher Review** — inspect teacher performance
- **Enrollments** — manage course assignments
- **File Storage** (`/principal/files`) — upload/view/delete files scoped to the school
- **Signup Requests** — approve or reject teacher/student signups
- **Password Requests** — approve password change requests
- **Activity Logs**

### `/teacher/*` — Teacher Dashboard
- **Evaluations Dashboard**: A centralized table for grading File, MCQ, and TEXT submissions across all courses.
- **Assignment Creator**: Dynamic, drag-and-drop questionnaire builder with support for multiple reference materials (files/links).
- **Submissions & Grading**: Evaluate student assessments directly in the browser with feedback and auto-calculated scores.
- **Course Materials**: Upload notes and manage assignment settings.

### `/student/*` — Student Dashboard
- Browse enrolled courses, view learning materials
- Submit assignments and track submission history

## 🏢 School-Scoped Data Handling

All data-fetching hooks automatically scope to the authenticated user's school. This is enforced at the **backend API level** — the frontend does not need to pass `school_id` explicitly in most queries, as the backend extracts it from the JWT.

**Key patterns:**
- `useFilesQuery()` → lists only files belonging to the logged-in principal's school
- `useCoursesQuery()` → returns only courses in the principal's school
- `useUsersQuery()` → returns only users within role → school boundary

The auth store (`authStore.ts`) decodes the JWT on login and stores `role` and `school_id` locally. This is used to:
- Initialize the correct role-specific route redirect on login
- Conditionally show UI elements (e.g., Hard Delete button visible to principal/super_admin only)
- Build `roleOptions` in the user creation form

---

## 🔐 Auth Flow

1. User submits credentials → `POST /auth/login`.
2. `access_token` is stored in Zustand `authStore`. JWT is decoded to extract `role`, `school_id`, `name`.
3. TanStack Router's `beforeLoad` on the index route inspects the role and redirects the user to their appropriate dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`, `/principal/dashboard`, etc.).
4. Axios request interceptor attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` automatically. On 401, it calls `POST /auth/refresh` and retries.
5. On logout, **all TanStack Query caches are fully purged** to prevent stale data from leaking across sessions.

---

## 📋 Signup Flow

Principals, teachers, and students register via the public `/signup` page:
- Principals may optionally select a school from the public school list.
- Teachers and students must select a school.
- On submission, a `SignupRequest` is created in `pending` state.
- The appropriate approver (super_admin for principals, principal for teachers/students) approves or rejects via the Signup Requests page.

---

## 👤 User Creation (Admin)

When a super_admin creates a user with **role = Principal**, an animated **"Assign School"** dropdown appears (populated from the public schools API). This immediately associates the new principal with a school, so they can start managing it without going through the signup flow.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements
- Node.js v20+
- npm

### Install & Run
```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # set VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
npm run dev
```
App: http://localhost:5173

## 🔍 Code Quality

Before pushing any changes:
```bash
npm run build          # must pass with 0 TypeScript errors
npx react-doctor@latest .   # must score 100/100
```

**Guidelines:**
- Always use `useQuery` / `useMutation` for backend interactions — never `fetch`/`axios` directly in components.
- Global Zustand stores are for **auth session and UI flags only** — not for server data.
- Zod schemas must precisely mirror backend Pydantic models to prevent runtime type mismatches.
- Avoid modifying `/shared/components/` unless the change is genuinely reusable across ≥3 features.
## 💎 UI/UX Standards

- **Exact Route Matching**: Sidebar active states utilize exact path matching to prevent overlapping highlights during nested navigation.
- **Event Integrity**: Interactive elements (like Download buttons) implement strict event propagation control to ensure zero accidental parent-triggering.
- **Interactive Reordering**: Sortable lists use `@dnd-kit` with optimized collision detection and smooth animations.
- **Automated Flow**: Students are automatically redirected to the course dashboard upon completing their final assignment attempt, reducing friction.
