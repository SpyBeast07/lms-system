# LMS System

A multi-tenant, school-isolated Learning Management System (LMS) for educational institutions. The system enforces **school-based data isolation**, **subscription-gated access**, and a strict **role hierarchy** across all operations.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This is a full-stack monorepo:

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18 + TypeScript + Vite |
| Backend | FastAPI + Python 3.12 |
| Database | PostgreSQL (async SQLAlchemy) |
| Migrations | Alembic |
| Object Storage | MinIO (S3-compatible) |
| Cache / Rate Limiting | Redis + SlowAPI |
| Background Jobs | APScheduler |

---

## 🏢 School-Based Multitenancy

Every entity in the system (users, courses, materials, submissions, enrollments, uploaded files) is **scoped to a School**. Data never crosses school boundaries.

### How Isolation Works

- **Database layer:** Every query for non-super-admin users automatically filters by `school_id` extracted from the authenticated user's JWT.
- **Storage layer (MinIO):** Files are stored under a `schools/{school_id}/` prefix and tracked in a `file_records` DB table with `school_id`, preventing cross-school access even at the URL level.
- **Request layer (SchoolGuard):** A FastAPI dependency (`validate_school_subscription`) is applied to all school-scoped endpoints. It verifies:
  1. The user is assigned to a school (`school_id` not null).
  2. The school's `subscription_end` date is in the future.
  - Super admins bypass this check entirely.

### School Model

```
School
├── id, name (unique)
├── subscription_start, subscription_end  ← enforces active access window
├── max_teachers                          ← caps teacher creation per school
└── created_at, updated_at
```

## 👥 Role Hierarchy

```
super_admin
    └── manages: schools, subscription windows, principal assignment
principal  (scoped to one school)
    └── manages: teachers, courses, enrollments, file storage, signup approvals
teacher    (scoped to one school)
    └── manages: materials, assignments, student submissions & grading
student    (scoped to one school)
    └── accesses: enrolled courses, materials, assignments, submissions
```

| Capability | super_admin | principal | teacher | student |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Manage schools & subscriptions | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Create / assign principals | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage teachers | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage courses | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Upload learning materials | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Grade submissions | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View & submit assignments | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| Access file storage | ❌ | ✅ (school-scoped) | ❌ | ❌ |

---

## 🔐 Subscription System

Schools are given an access window (`subscription_start` → `subscription_end`). When a subscription expires:
- All non-super-admin endpoints immediately return **403 Forbidden**.
- Education data is preserved — only active access is suspended.
- Super admin can renew by updating `subscription_end` via the Schools Management API.

```bash
cd lms-BE
docker compose up -d

## 🤝 Contribution Guidelines
1. Run `npm run build` and `npx react-doctor@latest .` — both must pass with zero errors before opening a PR.
2. All SQLAlchemy model changes require an Alembic migration: `uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"`.
3. Follow conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc.
